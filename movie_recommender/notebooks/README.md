## Approach
In line with the objective of building a recommender system based on users' behaviors as stated in the description, we will employ collaborative filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering is a powerful method that leverages the past behaviors or preferences of users to make recommendations.

### Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)

The Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model is a deep learning approach to collaborative filtering. It learns low-dimensional embeddings for users and movies, which are used to predict ratings. This model enhances traditional collaborative filtering by leveraging the capabilities of neural networks to capture intricate patterns in user-item interactions, leading to more accurate recommendations.

The NCF model consists of the following components:

1. **Embedding Layers**: Separate layers for mapping user and movie IDs to dense vector embeddings.
2. **Bias Layers**: Scalar bias terms for users and movies to capture overall rating tendencies.
3. **Dot Product**: Computes the dot product between user and movie embeddings to capture compatibility.
4. **Rating Prediction**: Combines the dot product with user and movie biases to predict the rating.
5. **Training**: Minimizes the binary cross-entropy loss between predicted ratings and actual ratings to learn the embeddings and biases.

The learned embeddings and biases enable the model to make accurate rating predictions for any user-movie pair, including those not seen during training, by capturing complex user-movie relationships and rating tendencies.
